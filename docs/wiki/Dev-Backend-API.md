# Backend API Reference

The `geniusai-server` exposes a REST API over HTTP (default port 19819). All responses use JSON with the structure `{ "results": ..., "error": ..., "warning": ... }`.

This reference is intended for developers integrating with or extending the backend. Regular users interact through the Lightroom plugin and do not need to call these endpoints directly.

---

## Server & Health

### `GET /ping`
Minimal liveness check. Returns `{"status": "ok"}`.

### `GET /v1/server/health`
Returns local model load state: `clip_model`/`clip_error` (SigLIP2) and
`face_model`/`face_error` (YuNet/FaceNet), each `"loaded"`, `"not_loaded"`, or
`"failed"`. It does **not** report cloud/local LLM provider availability —
the backend has no stored API keys or base URLs to probe on a bare GET. The
plugin checks provider availability itself (stored keys, an Other AI server
address, and whether `POST /v1/llm/providers/models` lists anything for the
built-in engines, Ollama and LM Studio); see `SearchIndexAPI.getDetailedHealth()` in
`APISearchIndex.lua`, which backs the Plugin Manager's "System Health" panel
and the Setup Wizard.

### `GET /version`
Returns the running backend version string.

### `POST /version/check`
Checks whether the backend version is compatible with the plugin version passed in the request body.

### `POST /v1/db/bind`
Called by the Lightroom plugin on first connect. Accepts catalog/configuration parameters and initializes per-catalog state.

### `POST /v1/llm/providers/models`
Returns the list of available AI models grouped by provider (`gemini`, `chatgpt`, `anthropic`, `ollama`, `lmstudio`, `openai_compatible`, `llamacpp`, `mlx`). The two local backends report what is installed on disk, so they are empty when no local model has been downloaded.

Body (all optional; POST so that no key ends up in a URL):

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `openai_apikey`, `gemini_apikey`, `anthropic_apikey` | Cloud keys. Without one, that provider's list is empty. |
| `ollama_base_url`, `lmstudio_base_url` | Where to probe Ollama and LM Studio. Absent means their default address on this computer — which is all the current plugin sends. |
| `server_url`, `server_apikey` | The user's own OpenAI-compatible server ("Other AI server" in the plugin): OpenRouter, llama.cpp `llama-server`, LiteLLM, vLLM, or LM Studio/Ollama on another machine. The address is normalised — no scheme means `http://` for local-network hosts and `https://` otherwise, a pasted `…/chat/completions` is cut back, and no path means `/v1`. The key is optional. |

```json
{
  "models":   { "openai_compatible": ["google/gemini-2.5-flash", "…"], "lmstudio": [], "…": [] },
  "servers":  { "openai_compatible": { "label": "OpenRouter" } },
  "aliases":  { "mlx": { "<old name>": "<name offered now>" } },
  "warnings": ["Other AI server: OpenRouter rejected the API key. …"]
}
```

`aliases` maps names a model used to be offered under, and that the backend still accepts as `model`, onto its current name: MLX models from the Hugging Face cache were listed under their snapshot hash before they were listed under their repo name. The plugin uses it to keep a saved choice selected.

A provider that is only probed and not running (Ollama, LM Studio) is simply empty. The user's own server is different: they entered it, so any failure to list it — unreachable, rejected key, malformed address — is reported in `warnings` in words the user can act on. So is an Anthropic key that is set but does not work (rejected, no credit, unreachable API): its listing failure comes back in `warnings` too. OpenAI, Gemini and Anthropic listings time out after 10 s so that a hanging network cannot hold up the whole list. The `anthropic` list is Anthropic's own `/v1/models`, filtered on each model's published capabilities: a model that cannot take images or structured outputs is left out. `servers.openai_compatible.label` (`OpenRouter`, or host and port) is what the plugin shows in front of that server's models. Only models that can take a photo are listed: entries a server marks as text-only (OpenRouter's `architecture.input_modalities`) and embedding models are dropped. An LM Studio entered as the user's server is not also listed under `lmstudio`.

### `GET /v1/server/logs`
Returns recent log lines from the server log.

### `GET /v1/server/logs/<log_type>/raw`
Streams raw log file content. `log_type` can be `server` or `plugin`.

### `POST /shutdown`
Gracefully shuts down the backend process.

### `POST /v1/server/restart`
Restarts the backend process. Note: this endpoint is known to be unreliable on Windows (see [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting)).

### `POST /v1/server/unload`
Unloads heavy ML models from memory without shutting the server down (useful to reclaim VRAM/RAM between sessions).

### `POST /update/apply`
Triggers an in-place backend self-update from the latest GitHub release.

---

## Photo Indexing

### `POST /v1/index/photos`
Indexes a batch of photos sent as multipart file uploads. Generates embeddings and/or AI metadata depending on options.

**Key request fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `photo_id` | string | Stable file-based photo identifier |
| `catalog_id` | string | Lightroom catalog identifier |
| `provider` | string | LLM provider (`gemini`, `chatgpt`, `anthropic`, `ollama`, `lmstudio`, `openai_compatible`, `llamacpp`, `mlx`) |
| `model` | string | Model name within the provider (for `llamacpp` the GGUF file name, for `mlx` the model directory name) |
| `api_key` | string | Key for `chatgpt`/`gemini`/`anthropic` (required) or `openai_compatible` (optional) |
| `server_url` | string | `openai_compatible` only: the server address, normalised as for `/v1/llm/providers/models` |
| `llm_n_ctx` | int | `llamacpp` only: context window override (0/absent = default) |
| `llm_n_parallel` | int | `llamacpp` only: photos decoded concurrently |
| `llm_gpu_layers` | int | `llamacpp` only: layers offloaded to the GPU (`0` = CPU only) |
| `temperature` | float | Sampling temperature, default `0.1`. Only the local providers (`llamacpp`, `ollama`, `lmstudio`, `openai_compatible`) use it: OpenAI reasoning models get a fixed `1.0`, Anthropic and Gemini 3 are sent none, and MLX's guided generation samples on its own settings |
| `reasoning_effort` | string | The plug-in's *Analysis depth*: `low` (default), `medium` or `high`. Sent as OpenAI `reasoning_effort`, Gemini `thinkingLevel` (3.x) or `thinkingBudget` (2.5), and Anthropic `output_config.effort` where the model lists that level; room for thinking (4096 / 8192 / 16384 tokens) is added to `max_tokens` for a model that thinks. Local providers ignore it. Any other value is a **400** naming it, not a silent fallback |
| `generate_metadata` | bool | Generate keywords/title/caption/alt_text |
| `create_embeddings` | bool | Create SigLIP2 semantic embeddings |
| `detect_faces` | bool | Run face detection on the photo |
| `regenerate` | bool | Re-process even if data already exists |
| `replace_ss` | bool | Rewrite `ß` as `ss` in the generated title, caption, alt text and keywords. Applied after the model answers, and only to those fields — never to the filename |
| `exposure_bias` | float | Exposure compensation in EV. Stored, and the decisive signal for culling's bracket detection. Omit when the camera did not record it; never default it to 0 |
| `is_raw` | bool | Whether the original is raw. Stored on the photo so later work (style training above all) can keep raw and rendered originals apart. Omit when unknown |
| `extra_context` | object | Optional context hints (folder, date, GPS, keywords) |
| `prompt` | string | The system prompt (the plug-in's "Instructions / Prompt" template). It *replaces* the built-in persona rather than extending it. Trimmed, and dropped when blank: a template the user emptied means "no persona of my own", so the built-in default applies instead of an empty system prompt. The edit routes read the same field the same way |
| `existing_keywords` | string[] | The photo's keywords, *without* face tags. Only reaches the prompt when `submit_keywords` is set |
| `existing_face_tags` | string[] | Names Lightroom's face recognition put on the photo. Sent apart from `existing_keywords` and labelled as people in the prompt, so a person's name is not read as a place (issue #315), and asked for by name in the title and caption rather than "a man and a woman" (issue #321) |
| `submit_face_tags` | bool | Whether `existing_face_tags` may reach the prompt. **Defaults to true**, unlike `submit_keywords`: a client old enough not to send this field only puts the names on the wire when its own keyword switch is on, so trusting what arrived leaves that client's behaviour unchanged. Governs the edit routes too |
| `location_sublocation`, `location_city`, `location_state`, `location_country`, `location_country_code` | string | Where the catalog says the photo was taken. Omit a field the catalog has no value for — an empty string counts as "a place is known" and suppresses the GPS lookup below |
| `gps_latitude`, `gps_longitude` | float | The photo's coordinates. Both or neither; a lone latitude is discarded |

All seven location fields are governed by `submit_gps` (default on) and, like the
keyword fields, are only read when metadata is generated. `submit_keywords` and
`submit_face_tags` are separate switches on purpose: sending "beach, sunset" and
naming the people in a private photo to a cloud provider are different
decisions, and each is expressible without the other.

`/v1/index/photos/by-path` carries `exposure_bias`, `is_raw`, `existing_keywords`,
`existing_face_tags` and the seven location fields per image inside the `images`
array instead, since they are properties of the individual photo.

**Where the location comes from, in order.** The catalog fields above win,
because they are the most current — a city corrected in Lightroom is never
written back into a raw original. What they leave open is filled from the file
itself: its EXIF/IPTC, read *before* normalisation, plus any XMP sidecar beside
it. Failing a place name entirely, the coordinates are reverse-geocoded offline
against GeoNames' `cities1000` and the prompt says the name was looked up and
how far away it is.

Reading the file's metadata before normalisation is the fix for issue #321:
normalising re-encodes every raw original and every JPEG over 2048 px, and the
JPEG that comes out has neither EXIF nor IPTC — so location context reached the
model only for small exported JPEGs, and silently vanished for anyone using
"submit originals" or an export size above 2048 px.

`/v1/edit/recipe` and `/v1/edit/recipe/base64` accept the same
`existing_keywords`/`existing_face_tags` pair, under the same switch.

**Species reaches the prompt, not the request.** When `tasks` includes
`species`, BioCLIP 2 runs *before* the LLM call rather than after it, and the
identification is written into that photo's prompt as the answer to use (issue
#326 — a general vision model captioned two rabbits as sheep while the species
field on the same photo read "European Rabbit"). A coarse rank is passed on as
a ceiling instead of a name. There is no request field for this: a photo
identified by an earlier run contributes its *stored* identification, so a
metadata-only re-run over already-identified photos benefits too. The line sits
in the per-photo half of the split prompt, so the run-constant KV-cache prefix
is unaffected.

**Response:** `{status, success_count, failure_count, error_messages, warnings, results}`.

`warnings` is where a *degraded success* is reported: the photo was indexed, but
an optional signal was lost — most often `"<file> faces: face model is not
downloaded yet …"` or the same for species. Metadata generation reports here
too: when the LLM returns `success` but omits a field that was asked for, the
provider says so in its own `warning` and it arrives as
`"<file>: the model returned no caption for this photo — the rest was kept …"`. These never fail the photo
(`success_count` still counts it), so a caller that ignores `warnings` shows the
user a clean run that silently produced worse data. Each entry also rides on its
own photo's `results` element as `warnings`, so a grouped caller can attribute it.

### `POST /v1/index/photos/by-path`
Indexes photos using server-side file paths instead of uploading image data (for local-backend
setups where the server has filesystem access).

A bounded number of files is read and normalised at a time, so a group of raw originals is
never all resident at once — the normalised JPEG is a few hundred KB and the raw bytes are
released the moment it exists. Decode is pure CPU and parallel across the group, which for a
run without `metadata` is the largest cost in the request; `GENIUSAI_INDEX_DECODE_CONCURRENCY`
sets how many run at once (default `min(3, cores)`, `1` restores the strictly sequential
behaviour). Results come back in submission order regardless, so a file that cannot be read is
reported as a failure against its own `photo_id` in `results`, not as an anonymous error for
the batch.

`llm_batch_size` is only meaningful when the run generates metadata. The plugin sends it as
the group size for a `llamacpp` run, and omits it otherwise — a group formed for decode
throughput must not override a provider's own preferred batch size.

### `POST /v1/photos/lookup`
Returns stored metadata and embedding status for one or more `photo_id` values.

### `GET /v1/photos/ids`
Returns a list of all indexed `photo_id` values, optionally filtered by catalog.

### `POST /v1/index/unprocessed`
Given a list of `photo_id` values, returns which ones are not yet indexed or are missing specific data.

### `POST /v1/photos/remove`
Removes all data (embeddings, metadata, face data) for a given `photo_id`.

### `POST /v1/photos/metadata/remove`
Removes only the AI-generated metadata fields for a given `photo_id`, leaving embeddings intact.

### `POST /v1/photos/catalogs/cleanup`
Disassociates the catalog from backend records for photos no longer present in
the supplied catalog inventory; it does not physically delete photo data. The
plugin resolves IDs without changing photo metadata and aborts if it cannot
resolve the complete inventory. The inventory is sent in one request (including
for an empty catalog), since separate batches would each remove associations
for photos outside that batch.

### `POST /v1/photos/catalogs/claim`
Associates an existing backend record with a (potentially new) catalog ID.
The plugin may scan the whole catalog for automatic or manual claiming, but
identity caching uses catalog plugin properties and never writes photo metadata
or Lightroom’s `lastEditTime`. The existing `photo_id` formats are unchanged.

---

## Semantic Search

### `GET /v1/search` / `POST /v1/search`
Runs a semantic search query against indexed photos.

**Key request fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `term` | string | Natural language search query. Also accepted as a query-string parameter |
| `catalog_id` | string | Restrict to a specific catalog |
| `photo_ids` | array | Restrict search to specific `photo_id` values (`uuids` is accepted as an alias) |
| `max_results` | int | Upper bound on results, across **both** halves of the search |
| `relevance_strictness` | int | 0–100. `0` disables the knee filter |
| `search_sources.semantic_siglip` | bool | Include SigLIP embedding similarity |
| `search_sources.metadata` | bool | Include substring search over the AI metadata |
| `search_sources.metadata_fields` | array | Which fields to match; defaults to `flattened_keywords`, `alt_text`, `caption`, `title` |

`catalog_id` and `photo_ids` are independent filters: passing both narrows to
their intersection. (Until August 2026 the metadata half skipped the catalog
check whenever `photo_ids` was present, leaking results from other catalogs.)

**Response:** `results` array of `{photo_id, uuid, distance}`. Semantic matches
come first, ordered by ascending distance; metadata matches follow with
`distance: null` and fill whatever is left of `max_results`.

### `POST /v1/search/similar`
Finds photos similar to a reference photo using perceptual hash (phash) or CLIP embeddings.

**Key request fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `photo_id` | string | Reference photo |
| `mode` | string | `phash` or `clip` |
| `scope_ids` | array | Optional photo_id scope |
| `max_results` | int | Maximum results |
| `strictness` | string | `strict`, `normal`, or `loose` (phash mode) |

### `POST /v1/cull/groups`
Groups a set of photos into similarity clusters (used internally by the culling workflow).

### `POST /v1/cull/grade`
Runs the full culling pipeline on a set of photos: grouping, scoring, and classification into picks/alternates/rejects.

---

## AI Develop Edits

### `POST /v1/edit/recipe`
Generates a Lightroom develop recipe for a photo sent as a file upload, using an
LLM.

> No plugin workflow calls this any more. *AI Edit Photos* runs on
> `POST /v1/edit/style` alone and never asks for the LLM fallback, so this endpoint
> and `/v1/edit/recipe/base64` are currently reachable only by direct HTTP callers. Both
> are fully supported; `SearchIndexAPI.generateEditRecipePhoto` in the plugin
> still speaks to `/v1/edit/recipe` and is simply not called.

**Key request fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `photo_id` | string | Photo identifier |
| `provider` | string | LLM provider |
| `model` | string | Model name |
| `api_key`, `server_url` | string | Connection fields, as for `/v1/index/photos` |
| `temperature`, `reasoning_effort` | float, string | As for `/v1/index/photos`, including the 400 for an unknown `reasoning_effort`. `/v1/edit/style` reads both for its LLM fallback |
| `intent` | string | Style preset key (e.g. `natural_pro`, `moody_dramatic`) |
| `style_strength` | float | 0.0–1.0, how aggressively to apply the style |
| `composition_mode` | string | `none`, `subtle`, or `aggressive` |
| `instruction_override` | string | Optional per-photo free-text instruction |
| `is_raw` | bool | Whether the *original* is a raw file. Optional; absent means unknown |
| `adjust_*`, `use_*`, `allow_auto_crop`, `include_masks` | bool | Creative controls. **Absent means enabled** — an unchecked box must travel as an explicit `"false"` |

`is_raw` cannot be recovered on the server: the plugin exports to JPEG before
uploading, so the original encoding is gone by the time the bytes arrive. It
decides two things:

- **How far the guardrails let a recipe push.** Raw files still hold detail
  behind clipped highlights; a rendered file does not.
- **The unit of `temperature`.** Lightroom's `Temp` is Kelvin for raw and a
  relative −100..100 for JPEG/TIFF/PNG. The declared JSON schema follows the
  flag so the model answers in the right unit, and normalization clamps to the
  matching range. A Kelvin-looking value returned for a non-raw photo is
  **dropped, not clamped** — clamping 6200 into −100..100 yields +100, a hard
  orange cast — and the reason lands in `warnings`.

Absent means unknown, which is treated as raw: that is what every catalog
indexed before the flag existed assumed.

**Response:** A develop recipe object with global adjustments and an optional
mask list, plus:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `guardrail_reasons` | string[] | Machine-readable codes for what the frame allowed or refused, e.g. `hard_light_no_added_contrast`, `flat_light_contrast_allowed`. Empty when the budget changed nothing |
| `guardrail_explanations` | string[] | The same, as sentences for the UI |
| `edit_warnings` | string[] | Unrelated problems worth surfacing (e.g. no training examples found) |

Before the recipe is returned, the backend decodes the image, measures the
scene (light hardness, dynamic range, specular fraction, shadow clipping),
derives a budget from it, and caps contrast-raising fields — `contrast`,
`clarity`, `dehaze`, the S-strength of the tone curve — plus `shadows` and
`whites` against it. The cap runs *before* the creative-control filter, so a
disabled field is never capped and then discarded.

### `POST /v1/edit/recipe/base64`
Same as `/v1/edit/recipe` but accepts image data as base64.

### `POST /v1/edit/style`
Produces a recipe from the user's own saved edits with no LLM involved: it
retrieves training examples similar to the photo, re-scores them on exposure,
scene and time of day, and interpolates their develop settings. Needs at least
five stored examples. The result passes through the same guardrail budget as
`/v1/edit/recipe` and carries the same `guardrail_reasons`.

`temperature` is blended only from examples whose `is_raw` matches the photo
being edited, because Lightroom's temperature is Kelvin for raw and a relative
-100..100 for everything else — averaging the two produces a number that is
meaningless on either scale. When no matched example qualifies the field is
omitted entirely, and either way the reason is in `warning`. Examples saved
before `is_raw` was recorded count as compatible with anything. Every other
develop setting means the same on both kinds of file and is blended normally;
`tint` differs only in range, which the clamp handles.

The `/v1/edit/recipe` few-shot path applies the same rule: an example whose raw status
conflicts with the target has its white balance stripped before it reaches the
prompt, so the model is never anchored on a number the schema it must answer in
cannot express.

---

## Face Detection & Persons

Two metadata fields on a face row carry a person, and the difference between
them decides what a re-cluster is allowed to touch:

- `person_id` — who the face belongs to. Empty or `person_unassigned` means
  nobody.
- `person_manual` — true when a human said so on the People page. A guess the
  clusterer may revise versus a fact it must preserve. Every editing endpoint
  below sets it, `POST /v1/faces/cluster` honours it, and re-detection during
  indexing carries it over.

### `POST /v1/faces/detect`
Detects faces in an uploaded image and stores their embeddings.

### `POST /v1/faces/search`
Finds photos containing faces similar to those in a reference image.

### `POST /v1/faces/cluster`
Re-clusters all stored face embeddings into person groups. The policy lives in
`lrg_analysis::face_cluster`; this endpoint is the store side of it.

Request fields (all optional): `distance_threshold` (cosine, default 0.5),
`min_faces_per_person` (default 2, `null` keeps singletons),
`linkage` (`"complete"` default, or `"average"`), `min_det_score`,
`min_area_ratio`, `min_sharpness`, `max_occlusion`, `attach_factor`,
`ignore_manual`, and `algorithm`.

What the default path does, and why:

- **Quality gate first.** A blurred, tiny, or half-occluded face is the one
  that sits between two people and welds them together. Faces below the gate
  may not *form* a person; after clustering they are attached to the nearest
  finished cluster whose centroid is within `distance_threshold × attach_factor`
  (0.9), or left unassigned. A face row indexed before this version measured
  quality has no scores at all — an unmeasured field never rejects, and the
  response warns that those rows were passed through ungated.
- **Complete linkage, not DBSCAN.** DBSCAN's density connectivity is
  transitive, so a single borderline face chains two people into one cluster.
  Complete linkage requires *every* pair across two clusters to be within the
  threshold. Passing `"algorithm": "dbscan"` restores the old behaviour and
  always returns a warning saying it chains.
- **Manual assignments are pinned.** Faces with `person_manual` enter as
  pre-formed seeds that keep their `person_id`, cannot be split, and cannot
  merge with a different pinned person. `"ignore_manual": true` opts out.
- **Canopy pre-partition above `AGGLOMERATIVE_MAX_POINTS`.** The agglomerative
  n×n distance matrix would be gigabytes, so a greedy centroid pass splits the
  faces into canopies at a loose threshold and each is clustered separately.
  This is reported in `diagnostics.canopies` and warned about, because a canopy
  boundary can split one person.

Faces whose row carries no usable embedding, or whose embedding came from a
superseded face model, are reported as unassigned rather than clustered — an
empty vector compares as distance 0 to everything and would merge unrelated
clusters.

The response carries `person_count`, `warnings`, and a `diagnostics` object —
`threshold`, `algorithm`, `clusters`, `pinned_faces`, `low_quality`,
`unmeasured`, `attached`, `dropped_small`, `canopies`, `mean_spread` and
`near_duplicates` — how many clusters have another cluster within 1.2× the
threshold, i.e. how many a slightly looser run would have merged. The last two
are what makes the threshold judgeable: a high `near_duplicates` means one
person is probably split across several clusters, and a `mean_spread`
approaching the threshold means clusters are being stretched over more than one
face.

### `POST /v1/faces/assign`
Moves specific faces to a person. Body: `face_ids` (required), plus either
`person_id`, or `"new_person": true` to allocate the next free id, optionally
with a `name`. Assigning to `person_unassigned` detaches the faces from
everyone. Every touched row gets `person_manual: true`, so the next
**Cluster faces** run preserves the decision. Face ids that no longer exist are
returned as warnings rather than failing the request.

### `GET /v1/faces/persons`
Returns all detected persons with `person_id`, `name`, `face_count`,
`photo_count`, `manual_count` (how many of the faces a human placed) and a
representative `thumbnail` (base64 JPEG, empty when the person has none). The
representative is the highest-scoring face by `det_score + sharpness`, not the
first row found.

Every face without a person — an empty `person_id` from a row that was never
clustered, or `person_unassigned` written by the clusterer — is reported as a
single entry with an empty `person_id`. The thumbnail is included here on
purpose: fetching it per person from `/v1/faces/persons/<id>/thumbnail` meant one
full table scan per person.

### `POST /v1/faces/persons/merge`
Merges two or more persons into one. Body: `person_ids` (at least two distinct
real persons — the unassigned pseudo-person is not one), optional `into` (the
survivor; defaults to whichever has the most faces) and optional `name`.

Every face of every person involved — including the target's own — is rewritten
to the surviving id with `person_manual: true`, so the merge holds through the
next re-cluster. The name is resolved in order: an explicit `name`, else the
target's existing name, else any name from a merged-away person. The merged-away
ids are removed from the names file.

### `GET /v1/faces/persons/<person_id>/thumbnail`
Returns the representative face thumbnail for a person as base64 JPEG. Kept for
older plugin builds; `GET /v1/faces/persons` already includes it, and this scans
the whole face table for one image, so it must not be called in a loop.

### `PUT /v1/faces/persons/<person_id>`
Names a person cluster, and by naming it confirms it. Body: `name` (empty or
absent clears it).

Every face of that person is marked `person_manual: true`, exactly as a merge
does, and the count comes back as `confirmed`. Naming is the user's claim that
the cluster really is one person, so the next **Cluster faces** run has to keep
it together — without the pin the name could end up on a different set of faces.

Clearing the name pins nothing (`confirmed: 0`) and unpins nothing: the same
flag also records hand-assignments and merges, and no row says which of those
wrote it, so undoing the naming would throw away decisions it never made.
Naming the unassigned pseudo-person pins nothing either. If the name saves but
the pinning fails, the request still succeeds and says so in `warnings`.

The People page uses this endpoint's name collision — a name another person
already has — as its merge gesture: it asks, then either posts to
`/v1/faces/persons/merge` or sends the name anyway when the user says the two
really are different people with the same name.

### `GET /v1/faces/persons/<person_id>/photos`
Returns the list of `photo_id` values associated with a specific person.

### `GET /v1/faces/persons/<person_id>/faces`
Returns the individual faces in one person, which is what the People page's
detail view is built on. Query parameters: `limit` (default 200, max 500),
`offset`, and `sort` — `typical` (closest to the cluster centroid first),
`outlier` (furthest first, which surfaces wrong faces) or `quality`.

Only this person's vectors are fetched, so the endpoint is cheap enough to page
through. Each face carries `face_id`, `photo_id`, `thumbnail`, `distance` from
the cluster centroid, `manual`, the four quality measurements
(`det_score`, `area_ratio`, `sharpness`, `occlusion`) and a `quality_note` when
one of them is below the gate. The envelope adds `total`, `offset`, `limit`,
`returned`, `name` and `spread` (mean distance to the centroid).

`distance` is what lets a threshold be judged by eye rather than guessed: a
face further from the centroid than the clustering threshold is drawn as an
outlier on the page.

## Browser UI (`/v1/ui/`)

Pages the plugin opens in the browser instead of rebuilding them out of
Lightroom's view factory, plus the queue they talk back through. The pages are
compiled into the binary from `crates/lrg-api/src/ui/`, so they can never go
stale against the server serving them.

A page can call the rest of this API directly — it is served from the
backend's own origin, so no CORS setup is involved — and it forwards the
`db_path` the plugin put in its URL on every request, which the auto-bind
middleware honours exactly like the plugin's own calls.

What a page *cannot* do is touch the Lightroom catalog. Those actions are
queued instead: the page POSTs one, and the plugin task that is waiting on it
drains the queue and performs it. Both ends stamp when they were last heard
from, so each can tell the user the other one is gone instead of appearing to
hang.

### `GET /v1/ui/people`
Serves the People page: person grid, renaming, re-clustering, filtering, and
the selection that becomes a Lightroom collection. Replaced the plugin's LrView
People dialog.

### `GET /v1/ui/status`
Page heartbeat. Returns `plugin_connected` — false once the plugin has not
polled for 5 seconds, which is how the page reports that People was closed in
Lightroom instead of silently queueing work nobody will run.

### `GET /v1/ui/actions`
Plugin poll. Returns every queued action and clears the queue, so each action
is handed out exactly once — a caller that drops the response drops the work.
Also returns `page_open`, false when no page has been seen for 90 seconds —
wide enough that a page throttled in a hidden browser tab still counts —
which lets the plugin report a browser that never opened.

### `POST /v1/ui/actions`
Queues one action for the plugin. The body needs an `action` naming one the
backend knows (`show_in_library`, which additionally needs a non-empty
`person_ids` array); anything else is a 400 rather than an entry nothing will
ever run. Returns `plugin_connected` as it was *before* the enqueue — the
answer to "will anything pick this up".

---

## Metadata Import

### `POST /v1/photos/metadata/import`
Imports existing Lightroom catalog metadata (keywords, title, caption, rating, etc.) into the backend database for a batch of photos.

---

## Keyword Management

### `POST /v1/keywords/clusters`
Synchronous keyword clustering: groups catalog keywords by semantic similarity.

### `POST /v1/keywords/clusters/jobs`
Async version: starts a background clustering job. Returns `202` with a
`job_id` and the `poll_url` to read it back from — see `GET /v1/jobs/<job_id>`.

## Async Jobs

Long-running work is enqueued by the domain that knows what to start, and read
back from one place. Every enqueue response carries a `job_id` and a `poll_url`
pointing here, so the poll location is never derived from the enqueue path.

### `GET /v1/jobs/<job_id>`
Returns `{status, result, error, progress}`, where `status` is `running`,
`done` or `error`.

A finished job is returned **once** and then dropped from the registry, and
jobs expire after 600s without activity (polling or reporting progress counts
as activity). A `404` therefore means the job never existed, was already
collected, or expired — not necessarily that the id was wrong.

### `POST /v1/keywords/merges`
Applies a list of approved keyword merge pairs to the backend's metadata records.

---

## Style Training

### `POST /v1/edit/training`
Stores one photo's develop settings as a training example. `is_raw` is recorded
with it and decides, later, whether the example may contribute a temperature —
see `POST /v1/edit/style`.

Saves a photo's Lightroom develop settings as a labeled training example.

### `GET /v1/edit/training`
Lists all stored training examples.

### `GET /v1/edit/training/stats`
Returns aggregated statistics about stored training examples (count per label, coverage).

### `GET /v1/edit/training/count`
Returns the total number of stored training examples.

### `DELETE /v1/edit/training/<photo_id>`
Removes the training example for a specific photo.

### `DELETE /v1/edit/training`
Clears all training examples.

---

## CLIP Model Management

### `GET /v1/models/clip`
Returns whether the SigLIP2 embedding model is downloaded and ready.

### `POST /v1/models/clip/downloads`
Triggers a background download of the CLIP model.

### `GET /v1/models/clip/downloads`
Returns the current progress of an ongoing CLIP model download.

---

## All Model Assets (combined)

The per-family routes below still exist and are what the detail view uses, but
the plugin's setup flows drive these instead: three downloads, three progress
bars and three ready indicators ask a photographer to care about which neural
network does which job.

### `GET /v1/models/assets`
Per-family readiness plus one overall `ready` flag and `missing_approx_bytes`
for the "this will download about N GB" line. All three families — `clip`,
`bioclip` and `face` — are `downloadable: true` and all three gate `ready`.
Face detection used to be the exception: its `buffalo_l` weights came from
`INSIGHTFACE_ROOT`, were not redistributable, and had to be excluded from
`ready` so the button did not stay red forever over something the download
could not fix. Replacing them with YuNet + FaceNet removed that carve-out;
`downloadable` remains in the response because the plugin reads it.

### `POST /v1/models/assets/downloads`
Downloads every downloadable family that is **missing**, under one progress
entry keyed `assets`. Families already on disk are skipped, so this doubles as
"finish setting up" after an upgrade. With nothing missing it reports
`completed` rather than idling.

### `GET /v1/models/assets/downloads`
Same shape as the other download-status routes.

---

## Species Model Management (BioCLIP 2)

BioCLIP 2 identifies animals, plants and fungi down to species. It ships as
three assets — the ViT-L/14 image tower as fp16 ONNX, a pruned Tree-of-Life
zero-shot head (`bioclip2_taxa.bin`) and its interned labels
(`bioclip2_taxa.json`) — from their **own** release tag
(`bioclip-assets-v1`), independent of the SigLIP2 `model-assets-v1` tag.
Roughly 876 MB in total.

The head is pruned from upstream's 867,455 taxa; see
`server-rs/scripts/bioclip_taxa_filter.toml` for the rules and for what
pruning costs at the species rank.

### `GET /v1/models/bioclip`
Returns whether the BioCLIP assets are on disk (`bioclip: "ready" | "not_ready"`),
plus `model` — the head identifier, e.g. `bioclip-2/taxa-v2`, read from the
labels file when the head is not loaded, so it answers without pulling 866 MB
into memory. Deliberately distinct from `/v1/server/health`'s `species_model`, which
reports whether it is currently resident in memory.

### `POST /v1/models/bioclip/downloads`
Triggers a background download of the BioCLIP assets.

### `GET /v1/models/bioclip/downloads`
Returns the current progress of an ongoing BioCLIP download. Same shape as the
CLIP and LLM download status; all three share one progress map keyed by asset
group, so a species download and a GGUF download can be in flight at once.

---

## Species Links

The pruned Tree-of-Life head carries taxon *names* only, no identifiers, so a
link from an identification to a species database can either be a name-based
search or a deep link to the taxon's own page. These routes buy the deep link:
they resolve a name against GBIF's `/species/match` and iNaturalist's
`/v1/taxa` — both free and unauthenticated — and cache the answer in
`~/.cache/lrgenius/species_links.json`, so a given taxon costs one outbound
call per machine, ever.

Everything degrades to search URLs: an unreachable network, an unknown name,
or a fuzzy iNaturalist hit that does not match the queried name exactly all
return the same shape with `resolved: false`. Deliberately kept off the
indexing path — indexing must not need the network, and a catalog's taxa
repeat so heavily that resolving on demand costs a handful of calls for a whole
library. Outbound calls are spaced ~1.1 s apart to stay inside iNaturalist's
published rate limit.

### `GET /v1/species/links`
Query: `name` (scientific name, required), `rank` (`species`, `genus`, … —
narrows both lookups so a genus query cannot match a same-named species),
`lang` (two-letter; picks the Wikipedia edition and the iNaturalist
common-name locale, default `en`).

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "links": {
    "name": "Panthera leo",
    "gbif_key": 5219404,
    "inat_id": 41964,
    "common_name": "Lion",
    "resolved": true,
    "urls": {
      "gbif":        "https://www.gbif.org/species/5219404",
      "inaturalist": "https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/41964",
      "wikipedia":   "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion",
      "wikispecies": "https://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Panthera%20leo",
      "eol":         "https://eol.org/search?q=Panthera+leo",
      "col":         "https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/search?q=Panthera+leo"
    }
  }
}
```

`urls` always holds every provider; `resolved` says whether any of them is a
deep link rather than a search. `wikispecies` deep-links without a lookup —
Wikispecies files scientific names as article titles verbatim. `wikipedia`
comes from iNaturalist and is therefore only a deep link for `lang=en`; other
languages get a scientific-name search on their own edition, which resolves
through the redirect each edition keeps.

The plugin calls this from `MetadataManager.applySpecies` and writes
`urls.inaturalist` / `urls.wikipedia` into the read-only `speciesInatUrl` /
`speciesWikipediaUrl` catalog fields, which Lightroom renders as clickable
links in the Metadata panel.

### `POST /v1/species/links/batch`
Same resolution for several taxa in one request. Resolved sequentially — the
rate gate would serialize concurrent calls anyway.

```json
{ "names": [{ "name": "Panthera leo", "rank": "species" }], "lang": "en" }
```

Returns `{ "status": "success", "links": [ … ] }`, one entry per requested
name, in request order.

---

## Local LLM Management (llama.cpp & MLX)

The backend hosts two local inference engines: `llamacpp` (in-process llama.cpp, GGUF models, present only in builds compiled with the `llamacpp` cargo feature) and `mlx` (an `lrgenius-mlx` helper process, Apple silicon only, no cargo feature). Both are exposed through the same routes — the MLX half is nested under an `mlx` key so that older plugins reading the top-level fields still see the llama.cpp engine.

### `GET /v1/llm/catalog`
Lists local models that are installed and those offered for download.

```json
{
  "installed":    [{ "name": "...", "model_path": "...", "mmproj_path": "...", "source": "downloaded|env|lmstudio" }],
  "downloadable": [{ "id": "gemma4-e4b", "label": "...", "approx_bytes": 0, "min_ram_gb": 16, "installed": false }],
  "supported":    true,
  "model_dir":    "~/.cache/lrgenius/models/llm",
  "mlx": {
    "installed":    [{ "name": "gemma-4-e4b-it-4bit", "model_dir": "...", "source": "downloaded|env|lmstudio|huggingface" }],
    "downloadable": [{ "id": "mlx-gemma4-e4b", "label": "...", "approx_bytes": 0, "min_ram_gb": 16, "installed": false }],
    "supported":    false,
    "reason":       "MLX runs only on Apple silicon Macs. …",
    "model_dir":    "~/.cache/lrgenius/models/mlx"
  }
}
```

`supported: false` always carries a `reason` for MLX; for llama.cpp it means the binary was built without the `llamacpp` feature.

### `GET /v1/llm/status`
Engine state (`status`, loaded `model_name`, …) for the llama.cpp engine, with the MLX engine's equivalent nested under `mlx`. `n_ctx` is the whole KV cache; `n_ctx_seq` is the share one photo gets, which is what a prompt plus its `max_tokens` has to fit inside. They differ whenever `n_parallel > 1`, because llama.cpp splits the cache per sequence. `n_parallel` is the effective value: the engine lowers a requested count that would leave each photo too little.

### `POST /v1/llm/downloads`
Starts a background download of a catalog entry. Body: `{ "id": "gemma4-e4b" }`. The id space is shared across both catalogs and the id alone selects the backend, so there is a single download queue: a GGUF pair is fetched as two files, an MLX entry as a repo snapshot staged into a hidden `.<name>.part` directory (which discovery skips) and renamed on success.

Or a model from Hugging Face that is not in a catalog: `{ "repo": "mlx-community/gemma-3-12b-it-qat-4bit", "engine": "mlx", "revision": "<sha from the check>" }`. The repo is checked again exactly as by `/v1/llm/downloads/check`, at that revision, and refused with the same 400/502 if it does not pass — so what is fetched is what was checked. A GGUF goes into a folder of its own under the llama.cpp model directory; an MLX model gets a `.lrgenius-source.json` naming its repo. When the model is already installed, the download completes at once with its `installed_name`.

### `POST /v1/llm/downloads/check`
Checks a Hugging Face model before anything is downloaded ("Other model from Hugging Face…" in the plugin). Body: `{ "repo": "<org/name, org/name:QUANT, or a huggingface.co address>", "engine": "mlx" | "llamacpp" }`.

- **400** `{ "error": … }` — the model cannot be used, with the reason and what to do instead: not a model name, no such public repo, gated, text-only, not an MLX conversion (or not a GGUF), an MLX `model_type` or `processor_class` the pinned mlx-swift-lm does not register (`hf_repo::MLX_VISION_MODEL_TYPES` / `MLX_VISION_PROCESSORS`), no tokenizer or chat template, no GGUF vision projector, a split GGUF, an unknown quantization. Also when the engine is not available on this machine.
- **502** `{ "error": … }` — Hugging Face could not be reached.
- **200** — what a download would fetch:

```json
{
  "engine": "mlx", "repo": "mlx-community/gemma-3-12b-it-qat-4bit",
  "revision": "<commit sha>", "dir_name": "gemma-3-12b-it-qat-4bit",
  "installed_name": "gemma-3-12b-it-qat-4bit",
  "files": [{ "path": "config.json", "size": 5000 }, "…"],
  "approx_bytes": 8031095500, "est_ram_gb": 11.1,
  "model_type": "gemma3", "quant": null,
  "already_installed": false,
  "warnings": ["This model is not in LrGeniusAI's tested list. …"]
}
```

For `llamacpp`, `files` is the model file then its projector (`Q4_K_M` and an `f16` projector unless a quantization follows a colon), `quant` is set and `model_type` is null. `installed_name` is the `model` to send once it is downloaded. The Hugging Face address can be overridden with `HF_ENDPOINT`.

Only one local model downloads at a time. While one is running, a second request gets **409** with `{ "error": "Another model download is still running. …" }` — it is refused, not queued.

### `GET /v1/llm/downloads`
Progress of the current local-model download (same shape as the CLIP download status). Once `status` is `"completed"`, `installed_name` is the name the model is now offered under — the `model` to send with provider `llamacpp` or `mlx`.

---

## Database Operations

### `GET /v1/db/stats`
Returns aggregate database statistics:
- total indexed photos
- photos with SigLIP embeddings
- photos with title / caption / keywords
- total detected faces
- total persons

### `POST /v1/db/backups`
Creates and streams a ZIP backup of the full persistent LanceDB data directory.

> **Not available:** `POST /db/migrate-photo-ids` existed on the retired Python backend and
> converted legacy Lightroom UUID-based IDs to `photo_id` values. It was deliberately not
> carried over (see the module comment in `routes/db.rs`), and the plugin no longer offers
> it: a database from before file-based `photo_id` values has to be re-indexed.
>
> The unrelated one-time ChromaDB → LanceDB migration is a CLI subcommand, not an
> endpoint: `geniusai-server migrate --db-path <path>`.

---

## Response format

All endpoints return:

```json
{
  "results": { ... },
  "error": null,
  "warning": null
}
```

- `results` — the payload (varies per endpoint).
- `error` — a string if an error occurred, `null` otherwise.
- `warning` — a non-fatal warning string, `null` otherwise.

On HTTP error responses (4xx/5xx), `error` is always set.
