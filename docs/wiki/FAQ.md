# FAQ — Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is LrGeniusAI?

LrGeniusAI is an AI extension for Adobe Lightroom Classic. It adds AI-powered metadata generation (keywords, titles, captions), semantic free-text search, automatic develop edits, image culling, face/person management, and more — all running locally as a background server without freezing Lightroom.

### Does it send my photos to the cloud?

Only if you choose a cloud provider (ChatGPT/OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, or a cloud service such as OpenRouter as the *Other AI server*). With a local provider — the built-in llama.cpp and MLX engines, Ollama / LM Studio, or a server on your own network — your photos never leave your machines. For cloud providers, images are sent to the respective API for analysis. Embeddings and all generated metadata are always stored locally.

### Does LrGeniusAI change my catalog or my image files?

It changes your **catalog**: keywords, titles, captions and alt text, its own metadata fields (species, culling results, AI model and run date), and — with *AI Edit* — develop settings. Lightroom counts each of those writes as an edit, so the photos get a new **Edit Date**. LrGeniusAI itself never writes to your image files, but if **Automatically write changes into XMP** is on in *Catalog Settings*, Lightroom writes the new metadata into XMP sidecars and into DNG, JPEG, TIFF and PSD files, which cloud or NAS sync will upload again. Back up your catalog before the first run — see [Before you start](Getting-Started#before-you-start-back-up-your-catalog).

### Which Lightroom version is supported?

Adobe **Lightroom Classic** only. Lightroom CC (cloud) and other Lightroom versions are not supported, as the plugin relies on the Lightroom Classic SDK.

### Is it free?

Yes, LrGeniusAI is open source (AGPL-3.0). Cloud API usage (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic) incurs costs at the respective provider's standard rates. Local models are completely free to run — including the ones the backend downloads and runs itself, see [Local AI Models](Help-Local-AI-Models).

### Is there a more minimalist version?

Yes. **[LrGeniusTagAI](https://github.com/LrGenius/LrGeniusTagAI)** is our earlier, lightweight Lightroom Classic plugin that focuses solely on AI-generated tags and descriptions, without the full server, semantic search, culling, or editing features of LrGeniusAI. It's a good fit if you just want quick AI keywording with a simpler setup.

## Installation

### The installer is blocked by Windows or macOS — is it safe?

Yes. The installers are not code-signed (cost and complexity for an open-source project), which causes operating system warnings. This is expected behavior:

- **Windows (SmartScreen):** Click *More info* → *Run anyway*.
- **macOS (Gatekeeper):** Right-click the `.pkg` → *Open* → *Open anyway*. Or go to *System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway*.

### The backend server won't start

1. Check that you completed the installer for the backend (separate from the plugin `.lrdevplugin`).
2. On macOS, make sure you allowed the binary in *System Settings → Privacy & Security*.
3. Try starting the server manually: `lrgenius-server/lrgenius-server` (macOS) or `lrgenius-server/lrgenius-server.cmd` (Windows).
4. Check the **Plugin Manager → Backend Server** section — it shows the server status and URL.

### Can I run the backend on a different machine or in Docker?

Yes. Change the **Backend Server URL** in *Plug-in Manager → LrGeniusAI* to point to the remote host, e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:19819`. Docker Compose files are included in the repository.

## AI Model Setup

### Which AI model should I use?

See [Help: Choosing AI Model](Help-Choosing-AI-Model) for a full breakdown. Quick summary:

| Goal | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Cheap bulk keywording | `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` or `gpt-5-nano` |
| Balanced default | `gemini-2.5-flash` |
| Best quality | `gemini-2.5-pro` or `gpt-5.4-pro` |
| Privacy / no API cost | Built-in `llamacpp` with Gemma 4 E4B |
| Apple Silicon, local | Built-in `mlx` with Gemma 4 E4B |

### Can I run AI analysis without installing Ollama or LM Studio?

Yes. The backend has two built-in engines — **llama.cpp** (GGUF; macOS, Windows, Linux) and **MLX** (Apple silicon). In *Plug-in Manager → LrGeniusAI* find the **Local AI Model** sections, pick a model, and click **Download**. Nothing else to install or keep running. See [Local AI Models](Help-Local-AI-Models).

### I don't see any models in the dropdown

The model list is loaded from the backend at runtime. If it's empty:
1. Make sure the backend server is running and reachable (*Plugin Manager → Status*).
2. Check that the relevant API key or Other AI server is configured — the line under **Other AI server** in the Plug-in Manager says whether that server answers.
3. For Ollama/LM Studio: they must be running (LM Studio with its local server switched on) when the task dialog opens. They are found at their default address on this computer; one running elsewhere is the *Other AI server*.
4. For the built-in local engines: a model must be downloaded first — the **Installed** line in the Plug-in Manager tells you whether one is present.

### Why is the MLX section greyed out?

MLX needs the `lrgenius-mlx` helper next to the server binary. It ships in the official macOS
installer, so a greyed-out section usually means a source build without the `xcodebuild` step —
the status line names the exact reason. On Windows the section is llama.cpp rather than MLX.

### Where do I enter my API key?

*File → Plug-in Manager → LrGeniusAI* → scroll to **Optional AI providers**. Enter your Gemini, OpenAI or Anthropic key there, or the address and key of an **Other AI server** such as OpenRouter ([Other AI Server](Help-Other-AI-Server)).

### Can I use OpenRouter, a llama.cpp server, LiteLLM or vLLM?

Yes — any server that speaks the OpenAI chat API. Enter it as the **Other AI server** under *Optional AI providers*, with an API key if it needs one. See [Other AI Server](Help-Other-AI-Server).

## Analyze & Index

### What does "Analyze & Index" actually do?

Up to four things in one pass:
1. Sends each photo to the configured AI model to generate keywords, title, caption, and alt text.
2. Creates a semantic embedding (using SigLIP2 locally) so the photo can be found by [Advanced Search](Help-Advanced-Search).
3. Detects and embeds faces for the [People](Help-People-Faces) workflows.
4. Identifies animal, plant and fungus species (using BioCLIP 2 locally) and writes the taxonomy to the plugin's metadata fields.

Every step is optional and each has its own checkbox — only step 1 involves a language model or a cloud account at all.

### Why did the Edit Date of my photos change?

Because Lightroom counts every change a plug-in makes to a photo as an edit. Each photo *Analyze & Index* processes gets the time of the run as its **Edit Date** — even on a run that writes no titles, captions or keywords — and smart collections that filter on *Edit Date* pick it up. Lightroom offers plug-ins no way to set the old date back, and putting old metadata back would count as another edit, so the only way to recover the previous dates is a catalog backup made before the run. See [Before you start](Getting-Started#before-you-start-back-up-your-catalog).

Up to version 3.2.1, LrGeniusAI could also change the Edit Date of **every photo in the catalog** — typically the first time a task ran — no matter which photos you had selected ([#397](https://github.com/LrGenius/LrGeniusAI/issues/397)). Later versions no longer touch photos you did not ask them to process; dates already changed by an older version can only be recovered from a backup.

### Does species identification send my photos anywhere?

No. It runs BioCLIP 2 on the machine running the backend, the same way search embeddings and face detection do. Nothing is uploaded, and it works with no API key and no internet connection once the model is downloaded. See [Help: Analyze and Index](Help-Analyze-and-Index#species-identification).

### Why did I get "Aves" instead of a species name?

Because that is the deepest rank the model was confident about. A clear frame of a garden bird gets a binomial; a distant silhouette gets an order or a class. The rank is written into its own metadata field so you can always tell which you got. Full explanation, including why some common names come back in Swedish, is in [Help: Analyze and Index](Help-Analyze-and-Index#why-the-answer-is-sometimes-just-aves).

### Do I have to index all photos before I can search?

Yes. Advanced Search only works on photos that have been indexed (embeddings created). Unindexed photos will not appear in search results.

### The AI generated wrong or low-quality keywords

- Try a more capable model (e.g. move from a small local model to `gemini-2.5-flash`).
- With a local model, turn **off** keyword aliases and bilingual keywords — both make the model emit structured keyword objects, which small models handle badly (often returning no keywords at all).
- Add **Photo Context** (folder names, capture date, GPS coordinates) to give the AI more information.
- Write a custom **System Prompt** in *Plug-in Manager → Prompts* to guide the output style.
- With a cloud model that reasons (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5/3, Claude), raise **Analysis depth** to *Balanced* or *Thorough* — the model thinks longer before it answers, at the cost of time and tokens.
- With a local model, lower the **Temperature** slider — lower values produce more consistent output. Models that reason ignore it; the dialog greys out whichever setting the chosen model does not use.

### How do I re-index photos that have already been indexed?

Enable **Regenerate all data (overwrite existing)** in the Analyze & Index dialog.

---

## Advanced Search

### Search returns no results

1. Make sure photos were indexed with **Create search embeddings** enabled.
2. Set the Lightroom collection sort order to **Custom Order** — otherwise results appear in random order and the best matches are not at the top.
3. Try a broader query — semantic search understands concepts, not just exact keywords.

### How does search ranking work?

Results are ranked by combining visual semantic embeddings with a text search over AI-generated metadata (keywords, caption, title, alt text). The final score reflects both visual and textual similarity to your query.

---

## AI Edit Photos

### What does AI Edit generate?

A structured Lightroom develop recipe of global adjustments (exposure, white balance, tone curve, contrast, presence, sharpening, and so on), built by matching the photo against your own saved edits. The recipe is applied via the Lightroom SDK — no raw pixel editing happens outside Lightroom.

### Which model does AI Edit use?

None. AI Edit does not call a language model at all — it interpolates the develop settings of the training examples closest to the photo. Model choice only affects *Analyze & Index*.

### AI Edit says my style profile is not ready

It needs at least five saved training examples before it can produce anything. Edit some photos the way you like them and run **Save Edits as AI Training Examples** (*Library → Plug-in Extras*). See [Help: Train from Edits](Help-Train-From-Edits).

### I want to review edits before they are applied

Enable **Review each proposed edit before applying it** in the AI Edit dialog. You will see the proposed develop values, the confidence of the style match, and any guardrail explanations, and can apply or skip each photo. (There is no rendered before/after preview yet — use Lightroom's History panel to judge the result.)

### Can I keep my original untouched?

Enable **Apply the edit to a new virtual copy** in the AI Edit dialog. Each edited photo gets a virtual copy named *AI Edit* and the recipe lands there.

---

## Cull Photos

### Does culling delete photos?

No. Culling is completely non-destructive. It creates Lightroom collections (*Picks*, *Alternates*, *Reject Candidates*, optional *Duplicates*) — your photos are never moved or deleted.

### Which photos need to be indexed before culling?

Photos need to be indexed with **Analyze & Index Photos** first. Face-aware ranking (eye openness, sharpness) requires face detection to have been run during indexing.

---

## People & Faces

### What does the "People" workflow do?

It lists all detected face clusters (persons) from your indexed photos, lets you assign names, and creates Lightroom collections per person. See [Help: People & Faces](Help-People-Faces).

### How do I enable face detection?

In the **Analyze & Index Photos** dialog, make sure face detection is enabled. The backend uses YuNet for detection and FaceNet for the embeddings it clusters.

---

## Keyword Management

### What is the difference between "Deduplicate Keyword Synonyms" and "Auto De-Clutter"?

- **Auto De-Clutter** runs automatically during indexing and prevents the AI from creating near-duplicate keywords of ones already in your catalog (e.g. if `Car` exists, `Automobile` becomes `Car`).
- **Deduplicate Keyword Synonyms** is an interactive workflow you run manually to clean up synonym sprawl that already exists in your catalog.

See [Help: Keyword Deduplication and De-Clutter](Help-Keyword-Dedup-and-Declutter).

---

## Troubleshooting

### Something failed — where do I see details?

- In Lightroom: after a batch task finishes, a **Task Completion Dialog** shows per-photo errors.
- In Plugin Manager: click **Show logfile** or **Copy logs to desktop**.
- On the server: check the terminal window where `geniusai-server` is running, or the log files in the server's working directory.

### Lightroom shows "Connection Refused" or "Cannot connect to server"

The backend is not reachable:
1. Check *Plug-in Manager → Backend Server* — the status indicator shows whether the server responded.
2. Verify the server URL (default `http://127.0.0.1:19819`).
3. Restart the backend manually if it crashed.

For more detailed solutions see [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting).

### I upgraded from an old version and search / metadata is missing

Versions before file-based `photo_id` values stored Lightroom catalog UUIDs as primary IDs,
and the backend cannot match those against your photos any more.

There is no migration — the one the plugin used to offer never worked, and has been removed.
Run **Analyze & Index Photos** over the catalog again instead. Photos already indexed under
the current IDs are skipped, so only the ones that genuinely need it are re-processed.
