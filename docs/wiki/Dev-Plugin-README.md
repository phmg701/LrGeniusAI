# LrGeniusAI Lightroom Plugin

AI-powered metadata, semantic search, and face workflows for Adobe Lightroom Classic.

---

## What It Does

LrGeniusAI adds a backend-powered AI layer to Lightroom Classic. It helps you:

- Generate metadata (`title`, `caption`, `keywords`, `alt_text`)
- Run semantic search on your catalog
- Detect, cluster, and browse people/faces
- Run image culling on selections or the current view and create result collections for fast review
- Generate and apply Develop edits, optionally trained on your own edits
- Deduplicate and declutter the keywords already in your catalog
- Re-import generated metadata back into Lightroom

The plugin is designed to work with local and cloud providers, while keeping Lightroom as your main workspace.

---

## Core Features

### Analyze and Index

- Batch-process selected, visible, all, or missing photos
- Generate embeddings for semantic retrieval
- Generate metadata
- Optional face detection and clustering
- Optional species identification (BioCLIP 2, on-device)

### Advanced Search

- Semantic search using image/text embeddings
- Metadata field search (`keywords`, `caption`, `title`, `alt_text`)
- Scope search to current selection/view/catalog

### People Workflows

- Cluster faces into persons
- Rename persons
- Jump from a person directly to a Lightroom collection
- The People interface opens in your web browser (served by the backend at
  `/v1/ui/people`); Lightroom keeps a progress bar running while it is open,
  which is what turns a selection there into a collection here

### AI Develop Edits

- Generate a Develop recipe per photo and apply it non-destructively, either to
  the photo itself or to a virtual copy
- No LLM involved: the backend matches the photo against the edits you saved
  yourself and interpolates theirs
- Recipes are constrained to what the frame can take: the backend measures the
  image and caps contrast, clarity, shadow lift and whites accordingly, and
  reports why

### Style Training

- Save your own Develop settings as labeled training examples
- The sole input to AI Develop Edits, which needs at least five of them

### Keyword Dedup & Declutter

- Cluster near-duplicate keywords in the catalog and merge them under a chosen
  primary term

### Metadata Sync

- Import existing Lightroom metadata to backend
- Retrieve generated metadata from backend
- Apply validated values back to catalog

---

### Image Culling

- Cull similar photos from **selected photos** or the **current view**
- Group near-duplicates and bursts using backend similarity signals
- Rank photos into:
  - `Picks`
  - `Alternates`
  - `Reject Candidates`
  - optional `Duplicates / Near Duplicates`
- Detect exposure brackets, focus stacks and panoramas and route them to a
  `Brackets / Stacks / Panoramas (keep all)` collection with ranking switched
  off — every frame of such a set is part of one picture
- Create a dedicated Lightroom collection set for each culling run and switch you directly to the picks collection for review

---

## Requirements

- Adobe Lightroom Classic (supported by plugin SDK settings)
- LrGeniusAI backend server reachable from Lightroom. Released for **Apple
  silicon macOS** and **64-bit Windows** — there is no Intel Mac or Linux
  build.
- Optional API keys depending on provider:
  - Gemini
  - OpenAI / ChatGPT
  - Anthropic (Claude)
  - an OpenAI-compatible server (OpenRouter, llama.cpp server, LiteLLM, …), if it needs one

---

## Installation

1. Build or download the plugin package.
2. In Lightroom Classic, open `File -> Plug-in Manager`.
3. Click `Add` and select the `LrGeniusAI.lrdevplugin` folder.
4. Configure server URL and provider settings in plugin preferences.

## Breaking Change: ID Migration

The plugin/backend use file-based `photo_id` values instead of Lightroom catalog UUIDs as primary IDs.
The stable ID algorithm was updated again to avoid ID changes when metadata is written into files (for example DNG metadata updates).

**There is no migration.** The one the plugin used to offer posted to
`POST /db/migrate-photo-ids`, an endpoint the Rust backend does not serve and
never has, so it could only ever fail. It has been removed rather than left in
place as a button that does nothing.

If you have an indexed backend database from a UUID-era version, run
**Analyze & Index Photos** over the catalog again. Photos that are already
indexed under the current IDs are skipped, so this costs nothing beyond the
photos that genuinely need re-indexing.

### Photo identity cache and Lightroom's Date Edited

Resolving an ID must never call `photo:setPropertyForPlugin` or change other
photo metadata. Lightroom advances `lastEditTime` even for private plugin
metadata writes. This was why automatic claiming could mark an entire catalog
as edited while the user had selected only one photo (#397). Restoring the
previous timestamp is not a supported SDK operation.

`Util.getGlobalPhotoIdForPhoto` now stores one JSON record per Lightroom photo
UUID in **catalog** plugin properties (`photoIdentityV1_<uuid>`). The record
contains the existing backend ID and algorithm, plus size/mtime for partial
hashes. This is persistent bookkeeping, so scans can still write catalog
properties, but never photo properties. UUIDs are cache keys only; the backend
continues to receive the same `meta1:` / `md5p:` IDs.

Existing photo-level caches are migrated lazily without clearing or rewriting
any of their four fields. Catalog records take precedence; `forceRecompute`
updates only the catalog record. Stable metadata IDs survive renames, file
rewrites and restarts. Legacy partial hashes retain their size/mtime validation
when the original is available. Offline photos retain a cached ID, or can get a
stable ID from metadata already in the catalog. Computing a new partial hash
still requires the original file.

Single/batch result lookup, scoped search, unprocessed-photo scans, metadata
import, analysis prefetch, claiming and cleanup all use the shared resolver.
Claiming and cleanup fail before sending their inventory if an ID cannot be
resolved or persisted; cleanup sends the complete inventory in one request,
including an empty inventory. Backend claim errors keep the migration pending.
Scans report identity failures instead of silently losing photos. No backend endpoint or photo-ID algorithm changes are required.

Catalog backups include the new cache. Exporting/importing photos into another
catalog may not transfer catalog plugin properties; there, existing photo-level
IDs or the unchanged metadata algorithm are used. Renamed photos without a
transferred cache retain the cross-catalog limitations described below. Cache
entries are deliberately not pruned when photos disappear; no automatic
identity reset or photo-metadata schema migration runs on upgrade.

This fix prevents future bookkeeping writes. It cannot restore Date Edited
values already changed by an older version. Applying actual metadata, keywords,
culling results or develop edits remains an intentional photo modification.

#### Lightroom smoke check (requires a disposable catalog)

1. Include uncached photos, photos with an older plugin ID, a virtual copy and
   offline originals. Record `getRawMetadata("lastEditTime")` for each photo and
   membership of Date Edited smart collections.
2. Select one photo, start Analyze & Index and allow the automatic claim to
   finish. Only actual result application to selected photos may change Date
   Edited; all other photos must retain their recorded timestamps.
3. Run manual claiming, scoped search, result lookup, “New or unprocessed
   photos”, and cleanup. Verify timestamps and smart collections are unchanged.
4. Restart Lightroom, rename/move a photo, and repeat lookup/claiming. Verify
   the backend IDs and result matching are unchanged. Reconnect offline files
   and verify legacy partial hashes still validate size/mtime.
5. With simulated unavailable catalog write access, verify an identity-save
   failure is reported and no incomplete claiming/cleanup inventory is sent.
   Do not run this on a production catalog.

## Breaking Change: Cross-Catalog Backend (Soft State, No Deletion)

When using a **shared remote backend** with multiple Lightroom catalogs, the backend no longer deletes photo data when a photo is removed from one catalog. Instead it only marks that catalog as no longer “having” that photo (**catalog_ids**). Other catalogs that still have the photo keep seeing it.

### What the plugin does

- Sends a stable **catalog_id** with all index and read requests so the backend can scope data per catalog.
- **Sync cleanup**: When you run “Remove missing photos from index” (or the equivalent), the plugin calls the backend to **disassociate** this catalog from photos that are no longer in the current catalog. It does **not** ask the backend to delete those photos.
- **Claim photos**: So that existing indexed photos are visible to this catalog under the new behavior, the plugin runs an automatic one-time “claim” on first use: it tells the backend to add this catalog’s **catalog_id** to all photos that are currently in the catalog. This runs in the background once per catalog with progress and a completion message. It resolves IDs without writing photo metadata.

### Manual “Claim photos for this catalog”

In `Plug-in Manager -> LrGeniusAI -> Backend Server` you can click **Claim photos for this catalog** to:

- Re-run the claim (e.g. after restoring a backup or re-adding many photos).
- Manually fix visibility if automatic claim did not run or failed.

This adds the current catalog’s id to the listed photos on the backend; it does not delete any data.

---

## Identity Scope Note

The current `photo_id` / hash / derived `canonicalId` strategy is more stable than Lightroom catalog UUIDs, but it is still not guaranteed to be 100% cross-catalog safe in every workflow.

Treat backend identity as best-effort and primarily catalog-scoped for now, especially when:

- the same files exist in multiple Lightroom catalogs
- files were duplicated, re-exported, or rewritten outside Lightroom
- the plugin had to fall back to partial file hashes because stable metadata IDs were unavailable

If strict cross-catalog identity is important for your workflow, plan for re-indexing or migration checks when moving photos between catalogs or restoring older databases.

---

## Configuration (Plugin Manager)

In the plugin settings dialog you can configure:

- Backend server URL
- Optional AI providers: the OpenAI, Gemini and Anthropic keys, and an **Other AI server**
  (any OpenAI-compatible server) with an optional key. Ollama and LM Studio have
  no settings: they are found at their default address on this computer, and
  one running elsewhere is the Other AI server.
- **Local AI Model (no external app)** — browse, download and select vision
  models the backend runs itself, plus the advanced knobs (context size, photos
  in parallel, layers on the GPU). Which engine backs this section is decided
  per platform: **MLX** on macOS, **llama.cpp** with GGUF models on Windows.
  The section reports why it is unavailable when the host cannot use it — a
  source build without the `llamacpp` feature, or a missing MLX helper.
- Export size and quality used for AI processing
- Prompt presets — a preset is the *system* prompt: which expert is looking at
  the photo, which vocabulary they use, how specific they may be, and what they
  must never invent. **Default** (the analytical voice) and **Family &
  Everyday Photos** (who, where, what for, using the names your catalog has on
  the faces) ship alongside genre presets for Wildlife & Nature, Landscape &
  Travel, Architecture & Urban, Events & Weddings, Sports & Action, Street &
  Documentary, Portrait & Studio, Product & Stock, Food & Drink, and Night &
  Astro. All editable; each is offered once, so an edit or a deletion sticks.
  Clearing a preset's text is an edit like any other and is saved — an empty
  preset means "no persona of my own", and the backend's built-in one is used
  for that run. `Default` cannot be deleted, and is put back if an older
  install lost it.
- Optional CLIP model download for advanced search

---

## Typical Workflow

1. Run **Analyze and Index Photos**
2. Optionally validate generated metadata
3. Use **Advanced Search** to find related images
4. Use **People** and **Find Similar Faces** for portrait-heavy catalogs
5. Run **Cull Similar Photos** on a selection or the current view to create Picks / Alternates / Reject Candidates collections
6. Re-run **Import Metadata from Catalog** if needed for sync

---

## Migration Notes

If you are upgrading from an older version that stored Lightroom catalog UUIDs as primary IDs,
re-run **Analyze & Index Photos** over the catalog. There is no migration path — photos already
indexed under the current IDs are skipped.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Verify backend connectivity in plugin settings (`backendServerUrl`).
- Check log files from Plugin Manager (`Show logfile` / copy logs to desktop).
- If search returns no results, confirm photos were indexed with embeddings.
- If faces are missing, ensure face processing was enabled during indexing.
